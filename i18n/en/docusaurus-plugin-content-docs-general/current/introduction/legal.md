## API Rights — Between API Providers and API Consumers (not APIX) ##

** Apix provides the marketplace, but the terms and conditions applicable to the APIs (including, the use of the APIs) are between API Providers and API Consumers (not Apix). **

With respect to each API, API Consumers and the API Provider who listed such API via the Service acknowledge and agree that the terms and conditions applicable to the use of and other rights with respect to such API by each such API Consumer are solely between each such API Consumer and such API Provider, and not with Apix. Each API Provider (not Apix) is responsible for all support and all claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement).

Apix reserves the right, but does not have the obligation, to review, screen, or monitor any links to any APIs or any API Content/Terms (as defined below) at any time and for any reason without notice. API Providers and API Consumers acknowledge and agree that Apix may remove any API or any API Content/Terms at Apix’s sole discretion.

## API Provider ##
### API Provider – Grants and Obligations ###
API Providers may APIs via the Service by completing Apix’s listing form.

For each API, API Providers must provide the URLs applicable to such API on the API Provider’s websites (“API Provider Sites”), a brief description of the API, the API pricing parameters (free use, unique object pricing, or subscription), any overage fees and any other applicable terms and conditions (e.g., service level standards) (collectively, “API Content/Terms”).

API Provider grants Apix the right to provide the APIs and the API Content/Terms provided by API Provider (or a party on its behalf) via the Service. Further, API Provider consents to Apix’s use of its name and, if applicable, API Provider’s company’s name and logo on the Site and our publicly-available online and printed materials, identifying API Provider (and, if applicable, API Provider’s company) as part of the Apix API network.

API Provider, not Apix, is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the API Content/Terms applicable to each API to which it grants an API Consumer access. API Provider acknowledges and agrees that Apix will not be liable for any actual or alleged breach of the terms and conditions governing the use of APIs by API Consumer (or any damages arising from or related to such actual or alleged breach).

API Provider represents and warrants that (a) all representations and warranties made by API Provider with respect to the APIs it lists via the Service are true and accurate; and (b) it owns (or has full rights to) to market, promote, offer to sell, sell, grants access to, and distribute the APIs it lists via the Service and all API Content/Terms posted to the Service.

In the event Apix provides API Consumer email addresses or other contract information to an API Provider, such API Provider may use such email addresses or other contact information solely to provide API Provider’s APIs to API Consumer in connection with the Service. In no event may API Provider bypass Apix’s billing, management, marketplace or Service and/or use any information obtained via Apix, the Service or the Site (including, but not limited to, any API Consumer email addresses or other contract information) for any purpose other than expressly authorized in these Terms. For example, API Provider may not use any API Consumer email addresses or other contract information to solicit API Consumers or other users to leave the Service or obtain APIs directly via API Providers or any non-Apix source.

### API Provider – Payments ###
Apix collects subscription fees and other payments associated with API Consumers’ access and use of APIs provide by API Providers via the Service (“API Fees”). Following Apix’s receipt of the API Fees applicable to an API listed on the Service by an API Provider, Apix will passed on such amount to the applicable API Provider less a Apix transaction fee. API Providers are paid on a monthly basis in arrears via the Service. Notwithstanding any terms to the contrary in these Terms, API Providers acknowledge and agree that Apix will use reasonable effort to collect API Fees, but Apix is not responsible for any failure to collect API Fees (including, but not limited to, any damages that arise out of, result from, are attributable to or are in any way incidental to such failure).

Apix, at its sole discretion, may modify its transaction fee with no less than 7 days advance notice.

## API Consumer ##
### API Consumer – Subscription Packages ###
API Consumer may browse listed APIs and subscribe to access and use APIs pursuant to one of the Apix API subscription plans selected by API Consumer. Depending on a particular API offering, API Consumer may also be able to arrange custom pricing and service directly with an API Provider.

Unless otherwise expressly set forth in the Apix subscription plan selected by an API Consumer, Apix subscription plans will automatically renew for additional periods equivalent in length to the initial Apix subscription period selected by such API Consumer. Each API Consumer may change the type of Apix subscription plan selected or terminate the Apix subscription plan according to the terms and conditions of such subscription plan.

### API Consumer – Fees ###
The pricing terms for each API Consumer’s access and use of APIs are set forth in the Apix subscription plan selected by such API Consumer (unless the API is not being purchased pursuant to a Apix subscription plan). All payments must be made in VND by credit or debit card via an authorized Apix payment processor.
